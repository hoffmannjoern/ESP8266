# ESP8266

## Version v0.1 
This is an Arduino library to support the Espressif ESP8266 WLAN module. _Beware_ this is an early version. The library is under construction.

Until now, the library supports the following 
* Send basic AT commands to the module
* Connect an access point
* Establish an TCP or UDP connection channel  to a server
* Send data over a channel to the server

##Installation
Create a new folder "esp8266" in the Arduino library path under "Documents/Arduino/libraries/esp8266".
Copy the files from the source under "src/esp8266.* to this new folder.
